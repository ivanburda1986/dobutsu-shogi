Next steps:
Visually disable all reference to advanced version of the game
...

The move representations have to be stored in the DB to make sure they are persisted for the whole game
Or they have to be at least re-created in the state upon reload
A move which takes over another stones is valid and should be included
A move from a stash to the field is valid
An automatic move triggered by the game (i.e. not be the player) such as a move of a taken stone towards the stash should be excluded from the representation. In the representation we are interested only in moves directly made by the players.




Repeating move-detection: -> tie
repeating the same row of moves 3x -> a tie
--represent each move by a string combination of: playerid, stone id, field from, field to
--continuously keep monitoring the last 6 moves
--if there is a repeating sequence of 3 identical moves, the game results into a tie
--warn players 1 move before a tie

pga1b1aeb2c2 = peter-giraffe-a1-b1-adam-elephant-b2-c2

pga1b1aeb2c2-pgb1a1aec2b2-pga1b1aeb2c2
             pgb1a1aec2b2-pga1b1aeb2c2-pgb1a1aec2b2

Algorithm:
if(moves.length >== 3){
    if(movies[movies.length-1] === movies[movies.length-3]){
        return true;
    }
    else return false;
}
return false;



moves.forEach((item,index)=>{
    let repetitionDetected = false;
    if(moves[index+2]){
         repetitionDetected = item === moves[index+2]
    }
    if(repetition){
    return repetition
    }
    return false
  }
)

compare: 0vs2, 1vs3, 2vs4, 3vs5




handling the "tie" game result
-if the game result is tie, display a message to the users
-update user stats with "tie" for both of them

Responsiveness for mobile

=================================================================
Refactoring and testing:
refactor the whole game
write automated tests in jest and RTL

=================================================================
Possible future enhancements:
a created game can be password protected

allow the player to send a link for a created game
--if a link is sent, the game is set to private only for the player with the link
--the game will open after the player logs in or creates an account

Gameplay
Display session details 
The player who starts is decided randomly

Display areas where players can place stones outside of the desk
Stone collision - stones cannot overlap
Drag and drop movement. Stones can be dropped on the desk only to specific areas (slots) to keep a neat look.
Each player sees the desk from their perspective
The rules of the game are evaluated by players themselves - not by the game itself. The game detects only the game end.
The game tracks the history of all moves
When one player wins the game shows a congratulation and a quote inspiring the players to thank each other for the game.
A player can surrender which ends the game.


Additional ideas: 
Game timeframe - can be specified by the admin when creating a session
Game can be saved so that the players can continue later 
A game session can be password protected
Statistics - stats for a specific games are visible only to its participants
Players can set a limit even during an ongoing game to speed it up. This option gets suggested automatically if the game is going on for some time.

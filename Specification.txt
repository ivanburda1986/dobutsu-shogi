Next steps:
highgligh stones which endanger a lion attemption to conquer a base

repeating the same row of moves 3x -> a tie
--store in the DB the last few moves (from-to coordinates) and if the same moves appear 3x in a row -> set game state to a tie

a game in progress cannot be deleted
launch screen indicates games in progress
launch screen indicates games waiting for an opponent
launch screen does not show finished games -> maybe a finished game can be automatically deleted?

resign option
--update game state
--increase loss for resignee
--increase win for the other

improve styling where needed - mainly the screen with games
refresh the stones after resizing the screen to make sure they are positioned correctly

=================================================================
Possible future enhancements:
a created game can be password protected

Lion victory evaluation:
move the lion to the opponents 1st row (can be an empty field, or you take there a stone)
but make sure that entering the opponents 1st row with a lion does not endanger the lion - if the lion is endangered, you lose instead

Next steps:
getting with lion to opponents edge, while not getting endangered by opponents stone -> victory/defeat
--getting all stones; compare whether an opponents stone is nearby a player's lion and step onto the position of the lion

show different winning/losing messages:
by taking a lion
by moving the lion to the opponent's first row

repeating the same row of moves 3x -> a tie
--store in the DB the last few moves (from-to coordinates) and if the same moves appear 3x in a row -> set game state to a tie

a game in progress cannot be deleted
launch screen indicates games in progress
launch screen indicates games waiting for an opponent
launch screen does not show finished games -> maybe a finished game can be automatically deleted?

resign option
--update game state
--increase loss for resignee
--increase win for the other

improve styling where needed - mainly the screen with games

=================================================================
Possible future enhancements:
a created game can be password protected

Lion victory evaluation:
move the lion to the opponents 1st row (can be an empty field, or you take there a stone)
but make sure that entering the opponents 1st row with a lion does not endanger the lion - if the lion is endangered, you lose instead


Algorithm:
Lion starts on B4
Lion moves to A1, B1, C1
-when moving there (either an empty field, or taking an opponents stone), get all opponents stones and select those which might be on these fields
--A1: A2, B1, B2
--B1: A1, C1, A2, B2, C2
--C1: B1, B2, C2

--from the selected opponent's stone find out whether any of them can move to the position of the lion
---if yes: the lion owner losses
---if no: the lion owner wins

Lion starts on B1
Lion moves to A4, B4, C4
-when moving there (either an empty field, or taking an opponents stone), get all opponents stones and select those which might be on these fields
--C4: C3, B4, B3
--B4: C4, A4, A3, B3, C3
--A4: B4, B3, A3
--from the selected opponent's stone find out whether any of them can move to the position of the lion
---if yes: the lion owner losses
---if no: the lion owner wins

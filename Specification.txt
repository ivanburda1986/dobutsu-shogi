Next steps:
a stash owner can take a stone and place it to an empty slot on the board
a chicken turns into a hen when moved while being on board to the opponents edge
a chicken does not turn into a hen when moved from stash to opponents edge
a hen turns into a chicken when it gets taken
taking the opponent's lion -> victory/defeat
getting with lion to opponents edge, while not getting endangered by opponents stone -> victory/defeat
repeating the same row of moves 3x -> a tie

a finished game stats are saved to each players data to serve as stats input
stashed stones of the same type get a number to indicate decking
indicate whose turn it is
the player who starts is decided randomly
resign option
launch screen indicates games in progress
launch screen indicates games waiting for an opponent
players profile shows stats: played, won, lost
when creating a game, a limit can be added for individual moves
a player not moving within the limit loses
a created game can be password protected
emphasise politeness - advise players to show courtesy and thankfulness

Question:

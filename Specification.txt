Next steps:
If a count is displayed for a stashed stones and 1 of the stones starts being dragged:
-decrease the count for the stone remaining in the stash
-hide the count for the stone that is being dragged
-if the dragged stone does not get placed the the board but rather returns the the stash, then the stash count should reflect it being back

getting with lion to opponents edge, while not getting endangered by opponents stone -> victory/defeat
--getting all stones; compare whether an opponents stone is nearby a player's lion and step onto the position of the lion

repeating the same row of moves 3x -> a tie
--store in the DB the last few moves (from-to coordinates) and if the same moves appear 3x in a row -> set game state to a tie

a game in progress cannot be deleted
launch screen indicates games in progress
launch screen indicates games waiting for an opponent
launch screen does not show finished games -> maybe a finished game can be automatically deleted?

resign option
--update game state
--increase loss for resignee
--increase win for the other

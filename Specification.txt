Next steps:
--a stash owner can take a stone and place it to an empty slot on the board
--a chicken turns into a hen when moved while being on board to the opponents edge
--a chicken does not turn into a hen when moved from stash to opponents edge
--a chicken turns into a hen when taking an opponents stone in the row where it would turn into a hen by stepping in
--a hen can move around
--a hen turns into a chicken when it gets taken
remove the "empowered" from the code

Next steps:
taking the opponent's lion -> victory/defeat
indicate whose turn it is
prevent players from moving when it is not their turn
stashed stones of the same type get a number to indicate decking
getting with lion to opponents edge, while not getting endangered by opponents stone -> victory/defeat
the player who starts is decided randomly
resign option
repeating the same row of moves 3x -> a tie


Future enhancements:
a finished game stats are saved to each players data to serve as stats input
launch screen indicates games in progress
launch screen indicates games waiting for an opponent
players profile shows stats: played, won, lost
when creating a game, a limit can be added for individual moves
a player not moving within the limit loses
a created game can be password protected
emphasise politeness - advise players to show courtesy and thankfulness

Question:
What happens if 2 alone lions remain on the board?
-the one that reaches opponents row faster wins the game

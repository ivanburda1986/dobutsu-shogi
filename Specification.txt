Next steps:
prevent players from moving when it is not their turn
--rely on the game-level indicator to allow/prevent moving

stashed stones of the same type get a number to indicate decking
--get all stones and check whether there are multiple on individual stash positions - if yes, dipslay a number for the impacted stash pocition

getting with lion to opponents edge, while not getting endangered by opponents stone -> victory/defeat
--getting all stones; compare whether an opponents stone is nearby a player's lion and step onto the position of the lion

resign option
--update game state

repeating the same row of moves 3x -> a tie
--store in the DB the last few moves (from-to coordinates) and if the same moves appear 3x in a row -> set game state to a tie


Future enhancements:
a finished game stats are saved to each players data to serve as stats input
launch screen indicates games in progress
launch screen indicates games waiting for an opponent
players profile shows stats: played, won, lost
when creating a game, a limit can be added for individual moves
a player not moving within the limit loses
a created game can be password protected
emphasise politeness - advise players to show courtesy and thankfulness

Question:
What happens if 2 alone lions remain on the board?
-the one that reaches opponents row faster wins the game

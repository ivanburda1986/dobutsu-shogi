Display areas where players can place stones outside of the desk
Stone collision - stones cannot overlap
Drag and drop movement. Stones can be dropped on the desk only to specific areas (slots) to keep a neat look.
The rules of the game are evaluated by players themselves - not by the game itself. The game detects only the game end.

A game session can be password protected

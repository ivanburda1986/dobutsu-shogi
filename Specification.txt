Next steps:
repeating the same row of moves 3x -> a tie
--represent each move by a string combination of: playerid, stone id, field from, field to
--store the last n moves in the DB
--continuously keep monitoring the last moves
--if there is a repeating sequence of 3 identical moves, the game results into a tie
--warn players 1 move before a tie

p1-sABC-a1-b1
p2-sDEF-b2-c2
p1-sABC-b1-a1
p2-sDEF-c2-b2

handling the "tie" game result
-if the game result is tie, display a message to the users
-update user stats with "tie" for both of them

Responsiveness for mobile

=================================================================
Refactoring and testing:
refactor the whole game
write automated tests in jest and RTL

=================================================================
Possible future enhancements:
a created game can be password protected

allow the player to send a link for a created game
--if a link is sent, the game is set to private only for the player with the link
--the game will open after the player logs in or creates an account

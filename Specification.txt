Next steps:
stashed stones of the same type get a number to indicate decking
--get all stones and check whether there are multiple on individual stash positions - if yes, dipslay a number for the impacted stash pocition

getting with lion to opponents edge, while not getting endangered by opponents stone -> victory/defeat
--getting all stones; compare whether an opponents stone is nearby a player's lion and step onto the position of the lion

repeating the same row of moves 3x -> a tie
--store in the DB the last few moves (from-to coordinates) and if the same moves appear 3x in a row -> set game state to a tie

a game in progress cannot be deleted
launch screen indicates games in progress
launch screen indicates games waiting for an opponent
launch screen does not show finished games -> maybe a finished game can be automatically deleted?

resign option
--update game state
--increase loss for resignee
--increase win for the other

=================================================================
Possible future enhancements:
when creating a game, a limit can be added for individual moves
-a player not moving within the limit loses

a created game can be password protected

Question:
What happens if 2 alone lions remain on the board?
-the one that reaches opponents row faster wins the game
